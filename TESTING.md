In this Readme, the testing of this E-Commerce Store can ben seen for my 4th Milestone Project at The Code Institute

## Automated testing

In the below section, the various automated testings are shown for each languages used.

### HTML - W3C Markup Validation Service

I have run W3C Validation on all HTML files. 
There were several warnings and errors regarding Jinja2 language which I will ignore as Jinja2 was used correctly.

There were other errors that I have ignored with the explanation below:

*Non-space characters found without seeing a doctype first.*
sdfds
<br>

Consider adding a lang attribute to the html start tag to declare the language of this document.
sdfds
Illegal character in path segment: { is not allowed.
Element hr not allowed as child of element ul in this context. 
Iframe: Bad value 100% for attribute width on element iframe: Expected a digit but saw % instead.
Element div not allowed as child of element ul in this context.
